## Sequencing data
The cDNA and DNA barcode libraries were sequenced with read lengths of 28 bases (read 1) and 126 bases (read 2). Read 1 contains UMI and cell barcode asin 10X Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v 3.1 (16 bases for cell barcode, 12 bases for UMI). Read 2 contains cDNA information (for cDNA libraries) or 8 bases DNA bardodes (for DNA barcode libraries). Raw fastq files are available at ArrayExpress accession E-MTAB-12819.
